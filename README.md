Applications developed during the Dart/Flutter bootcamp. Main applications:

* /lista_de_contatos_bd: A list of contacts linked to an SQLite database;
* /lista_de_tarefas: A simple contact list;
* /projeto_final_minicurso: A photo gallery that uses geolocation libraries, linked to an SQLite database.

OBS: Contains git repository conflicts in some files (Sorry, this repository was my first experience with git).
